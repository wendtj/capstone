    <p><b>Tuesday, November 23rd</b><br>
    First Entry<br>
    I am already well through my project, I have finished both HTML "games" and both Python games. I have also presented them to Mrs. Lujan and she has approved. However, as Mrs. Lujan is leaving Explore after term 4, my new advisor will be Mr. Robinson.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Wednesday, November 24th</b><br>
    I have signed up to learn C++ via codecademy.com</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Tuesday, November 30th</b><br>
    I did my first course and also learned about copiling.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Thursday, December 2nd</b><br>
    Started doing variables in C++.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Friday, December 3rd</b><br>
    Finished learning variables</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Wednesday, December 8th</b><br>
    Started doing conditionals and logic.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Friday, December 9th</b><br>
    Finished conditionals and logic, started loops.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Tuesday, December 14th</b><br>
    Finished loops, started functions.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Friday, December 17th</b><br>
    C++ functions are confusing.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Tuesday, December 21st</b><br>
    I'm starting to see that this course was sloppily made. There is no solution for this emergency number problem.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Monday, December 27th</b><br>
    I had to resort to a forum to even get past this question. I've done that a few times since then because the course has gone down in quality since I started.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Tuesday, Janruary 10th</b><br>
    School has started again and I'm not done. At least I have time to work on it in class now that I'm doing my capstone class.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Thursday, Janruary 13th</b><br>
    I'm not done with the course, but I feel like I know enough of it to start making the projects for it.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Wednesday, Janruary 19th</b><br>
    Made the first C++ project.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Friday, Janruary 21st</b><br>
    Finished the second one, it was a bit bigger of a project. But it's a nice way to end off the project.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Monday, Janruary 24th</b><br>
    I'm getting close to the presentation date. I have to work hard on the presentation website. Luckily I already know how to make one and don't have to learn how to haha.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Wednesday, Janruary 26rd</b><br>
    Started the layout for the main page, completed the project exploration page.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Thursday, Janruary 27th</b><br>
    Imported my progress journal into the website and started the presentation bit.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Friday, Janruary 28th</b><br>
    Created the 'Introduction to each language' page. Added a loading in animation to some pages.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Monday, Janruary 31st</b><br>
    Created the evaluation (pros and cons) page for each language, hoping to finish the verdict/conclusion page tomorrow, polish it on Wed, and upload the website on Thurs.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Wednesday, February 2nd</b><br>
    Started the verdict page. Presentation date postoponed to Monday because of online school this week. I had a meeting with my advisor to talk about my presentation.</p><br>

      <h1>Zero-sum game</h1>
      <p>A zero-sum game is defined as:<br>mathematical representation in game theory and economic theory of a situation which involves two sides, where the result is an advantage for one side and a loss for the other. If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.<br><br>Let's put this into simple terms.<br>It is a game with zero or more winners, and an equal amount of losers.<br><br>For example: Tic Tac Toe</p>

      <p>Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum game because you can have three results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You win, opponent loses</li>
        <li>You lose, opponent wins</li>
        <li>Cat game (tie)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Zero-sum games can be as simple as Tic Tac Toe, or as complicated as Chess, as long as the number of winners equals the number of losers.</p> <br><br>

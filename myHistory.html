    <h1 class=animateIn>Why did I choose this topic?</h1><br>
      <p class=animateInTwo>I first got interested in coding when I started trying out scratch in 2015.It didn't go much further from there, just a few short classes meant to get people interested in coding rather than delving deep. But last year, I noticed that a coding class was being offered at Explore. I signed up for Mrs. Olivas HTML class during the first virtual learning period, which inspired me to learn more coding. I self-taught (with some help with a few friends on the internet, and stackOverflow) Python over the summer, the next school year I took another HTML class with Mrs. Olivas, as well as a JavaScript class with her. I was progressing a lot and having fun with it so I decided I'd do my capstone project on it. However, Mrs. Olivas had to go on maternity leave, and I felt like I did not have enough knowledge to do a full project. So, I took it upon myself to learn a more powerful, therefore 'harder' language. I spent about a month and a half Learning basic C++.<br><br>
        Now we get to today. I've created two small games with each coding language I know. One of those two games are the same in order to compare more easily, and the others differ for variety's sake. <br><br><br>
